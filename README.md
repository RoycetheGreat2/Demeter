## Security Implementations

Demeter is built with robust security measures to ensure data integrity and user safety in a production environment:
- Strict AI system prompts and regex filters to prevent prompt injection and character-breaking.

- Complete sanitization of user input to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and HTML injection.
- Parameterized database queries to guarantee protection against SQL injection.
